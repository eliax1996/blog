Hi I'm James Chua. Currently I'm looking for a job in the field of AI alignment. Previously I've worked as a machine learning engineer (LeadiQ 2020-2023), and as an alignment researcher (MATS 2023). 

I've cowrote a paper on [reducing biased reasoning in language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05518).


I enjoy making typesafe python packages such as [Slist](https://github.com/thejaminator/slist).
