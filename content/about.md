Hi, I'm Elia Migliore!

Right now, I work as a software engineer at [Aiven](https://aiven.io/), where I'm helping to develop Kafka and related products.

I'm the kind of person who likes to try out different things.
Some might say I don't stick to one thing for long, but I see it as always being curious and eager to learn new things, while also striving to combat boredom.

In a previous chapter of my life, I spent roughly two years as a math researcher. To be honest, during that time, I focused more on studying rather than coming up with new ideas. My research mainly revolved around Optimization/ML and formal system topics, back when they weren't as popular or talked about.

After that, I got interested in distributed systems and functional programming. I learned a lot about Scala and really liked it.

A few years later, I got frustrated with how slow things were moving in the big data world. I also realized I was more interested in understanding how things worked on the inside rather than just using them.

So now, I'm working on using what I know about databases and distributed systems to help make products at Aiven.

I'm constantly on the lookout for new learning opportunities, particularly when it involves tackling complex problems. If you're interested in what I'm working on, you can check out [my Github account](https://github.com/eliax1996) although much of my work is internal. I'm striving to allocate more time to contributing to open source projects.

Feel free to email me at [migliorelia\@gmail.com](mailto:migliorelia@gmail.com?subject=Reaching%20you%20by%20the%20blog)  if you want to chat, do a crazy experiment or work together on something!
